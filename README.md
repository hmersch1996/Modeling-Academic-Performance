# Modeling-Academic-Performance
In this repository, we will perform tests to analyze which parameter helps to predict with a higher precision whether or not a college student passes or fails the couse. 
These tests will be performed using logistic regression. When the highest predicting model is obtained, we will implement a MLP neural network in order to improve accuracy
